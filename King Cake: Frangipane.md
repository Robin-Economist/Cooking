* 100g butter (softened)
* 1 to 2 eggs (2 is recommended for better texture)

### Instructions

1.  **Prepare the Cream:**
    * Cut the butter into small pieces and place them in a mixing bowl (*terrine*).
    * Work the butter with a spatula to soften it completely.
    * Add the sugar and continue mixing until it turns into a creamy texture.
    * Whisk in the beaten eggs (for the cream), the flour, the rum (if using), and the almond powder. Mix until the preparation is smooth and homogeneous.

2.  **Prepare the Oven:**
    * Preheat the oven to **180°C** (approx 350°F). It needs to be hot.

3.  **Assembly:**
    * Roll out the puff pastry into 2 equal discs.
    * Place the first disc on a baking sheet (slightly dampened with water to prevent sliding).
    * Spread the almond cream over the dough, leaving a border of about **3cm** (1 inch) free around the edges.
    * **Hide the *fève* in the cream!**
    * Cover with the second disc of dough. Press the edges to seal them.

4.  **Decoration & Baking:**
    * Use a fork to draw a crosshatch pattern (*croisillons*) on top of the galette.
    * Brush the top with the beaten egg (from the base ingredients) to make it golden.
    * Bake for approximately **30 minutes**.

5.  **Serving:**
    * Serve warm (*tiède*) for the best taste.
