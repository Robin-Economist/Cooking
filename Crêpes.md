### Ingredients for around 12-15 medium-size crêpes - 3 persons

* **250g flour** (The lower the protein content, the better. I used T65 with 9g protein/100g, but T45 or around 7g is ideal).
* **550ml fresh whole milk** (Raw milk is fine, but it implies it must be fresh from the refrigerated section).
* **4 eggs**
* **2 tablespoons sugar** (I use vanilla sugar).
* **1 pinch of salt**
* **250g butter** (browned/noisette).

### Instructions
1.  **Prepare the butter:** Melt the butter in a saucepan until it is fully melted and reaches a hazelnut color (*beurre noisette*).
2.  **Mix the base:** Whisk the flour with the milk. **Important:** The milk must be cold (straight from the fridge).
3.  **Add ingredients:** Add the eggs, sugar, and salt, then mix well.
4.  **Combine:** Pour in the melted browned butter and mix again.
5.  **Rest:** Let the batter (*pâte*) rest for 2 hours in a warm spot (not directly on a heat source, but near one—for example, near the stove where you melted the butter).

> **⚠️ Disclaimer:** Be very gentle when flipping the crêpes. The high butter content makes them extremely fragile!
